-------------------------------------------

 * gentufa'i is now self-hosting.


.i detri fa li renopano pi'e papa pi'e pamu
-------------------------------------------

 * I've checked in the first version of the bootstrap PEG parser.
   It isn't feature complete yet, it does not support code blocks
   in the grammar yet.

   For every test that does not use code, the bootstrap PEG parser
   is now tested against a PEG grammar version of that test.

-------------------------------------------

 * I've added project documentation, 00-*, to the repository.
 * I've converted this repository to git.


.i detri fa li renopano pi'e pano pi'e cipa
-------------------------------------------

 * I've fixed a bug where with any sufficiently complex grammar I
   would not return the proper abstract syntax tree.  I was walking
   the val member of javni-valsi as if it were a flat list, when it
   fact it could be returned as a tree.
 * I've added nunjavni-re and nunjavni-. rule generators.  "re" is
   regular expression, and "." is the match any single character
   rule.

 * The salmonella report indicates my egg didn't build today:

     http://tests.call-cc.org/current/salmonella-report/genturfahi.html

   I was missing a dependency on utf8.  I've corrected this in the
   repository.

-------------------------------------------

 * [.alyn.post.] I have released the initial version of this
   package.  I made an announcement on the chicken-users mailing
   list:

     http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-users/2012-10/msg00184.html

 * I've added full documentation for this package to the Chicken
   wiki:

     http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/genturfahi

 * I've added test cases for every feature of this package.  The
   places that could use more testing:

     * samselpla: It works, but I don't verify the code doesn't
                  execute until the end of the parse.
     * morji:     I use the memoization code, but I haven't verified
                  I'm using every code path in it, nor have I tested
                  it is behaving as I expect it to.

 * I found a bug in the handling of #!optional parameters to
   functions, and filed a ticket:

     https://bugs.call-cc.org/ticket/421

   The bug is fixed in commit bcea30312d1c4f3c6815dcb73b79a2ad9d08e288,
   and I've converted my code to use #!key, which doesn't have this
   issue.  By using #!key rather than #!optional, this module won't
   depend on the experimental branch of chicken.


.i detri fa li renopano pi'e pano pi'e reze
-------------------------------------------

 * [.alyn.post.] genturfa'i is now feature compatible with Tony
   Garnock-Jones' packrat parser.


.i detri fa li renopano pi'e pano pi'e paze
-------------------------------------------

 * [.alyn.post.] Enable utf8 text input.  Some Lojban text uses
   the guillemot and other non-ASCII punctuation.  utf8 is not
   currently tested.
 * [.alyn.post.] Converted (! nonterminal-id) parts to () parts,
   matching the empty set.  I discovered how to parse the empty
   set after reading the uri-generic parser.  I didn't previously
   believe the feature was supported.


.i detri fa li renopano pi'e pano pi'e paxa
-------------------------------------------

 * [.alyn.post.] Added --help and --version command-line options
   using args-fold from srfi-37.
 * [.alyn.post.] This packaged is officially version 0.0.1.


.i detri fa li renopano pi'e pano pi'e pano
-------------------------------------------

 * [.alyn.post.] Added this file 00-gafpoi (.i.e., ChangeLog),
   describing jbogi'e, a Lojban parser. 
 * [.alyn.post.] This software is available under an ISC license, as
   stated in the file LICENSE.
 * [.alyn.post.] Added the file 00-ci'arfi'i (i.e., AUTHORS), with my
   name in it.
 * [.alyn.post.] Added the file 00-selgu'a (.i.e., TODO),
   describing the sprint and product backlogs.
 * [.alyn.post.] Added the file 00-tisetcidu (.i.e., README),
   describing genturfa'i, a packrat parser. 
 * [.alyn.post.] I've created the basic project infrastructure for my
   packrat parser, genturfa'i.  This is a PEG parser written in
   Scheme.
