Sprint Backlog
--------------

 * [open] gensym non-terminal names to avoid collision when
          define-toplevel is set.
 * [open] Update wiki documentation to match current code.


Product Backlog
---------------

Release 1.1:

 * [] Port to a second Scheme implementation. 
 * [] Ignore & and ! rather than returning the empty string.  This
      requires support in je and jonai as well.
 * [] Write tests for PEG file parser.
 * [] extend the character class test to test all character
      classes.
 * [] Implement left recursion.

Release 1.0:

 * [] utf8 testing and performance improvement.  Either remove utf8
      or make string-ref O(1).
 * [] Performance testing and optimization:
       + which (declare ...) options lead to performance improvements?
       + should the input buffer be a string or a list of characters?
       + should I use a hash or assoc list for memoization and
         symbol generation?
       + Is a record-type or cons faster?
       + Inline input buffer access routines.
 * [] Write PEG parser application manpage. 
 * [done] Permit multiple non-terminals to have an external
          definition
 * [done] Compile the expression '()' as the empty string.
 * [done] detect runtime options empty-string, sentinel, &c and
          enabled them for runtime code.
 * [done] use srfi-14/iset for character class comparison, removing
          the dependency on irregex code.
 * [done] implement secuxna module, global options for the parse.
 * [done] Create a PEG file parser application.
 * [wont] Create a wrapper to export English translations of the API
          code.
 * [done] Create grammar for PEG file parsing.
 * [done] Create bootstrap compiler for file parser.
 * [done] Create grammar for PEG file parser.
 * [done] Add full API documentation.
 * [done] Add test cases for each syntax element in the parser. 
 * [done] Create a Chicken Scheme egg for this project.
 * [done] Implement code for each syntactic element in packrat
          parsers:
   * [done] terminals
   * [done] empty string
   * [done] end of input
   * [done] sequence
   * [done] ordered-choice
   * [done] zero-or-more
   * [done] one-or-more
   * [done] optional
   * [done] and-predicate
   * [done] not-predicate
