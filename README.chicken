chicken-ext.scm and chicken-ext-peg.scm are the wrapper files containing
Chicken Scheme specific code.

main-srfi-37.scm is the wrapper file containing support for running
scheme code as an executable program.

Everything else here is intended to run on other suitably featured
Scheme implementations.
